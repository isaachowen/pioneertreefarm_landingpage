					<h3>1. Planning Ahead</h3>
					<p>Wear warm clothes, and boots if it's cold or wet -- tractor lanes can get muddy. Good gloves are helpful (spruce trees in particular are a little prickly).  A piece of plastic or cardboard is sometimes useful, if the ground is moist -- cutting the tree involves getting down low.  An old blanket and rope may come in handy if you plan to tie the tree on your car. We'll have baling twine on hand if you need it.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3>2. Type of Tree</h3>
					<p>Any evergreen tree can make a beautiful Christmas tree. Junipers, spruces, cedars and firs have the shortest needles. Scotch pines have stiff, medium length needles. White pine needles are longer and softer. Red pines have the longest needles. Some trees may be uneven on one side because they grew close to another tree. With the flatter side next to a wall they can be great space savers!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3>3. Finding the Tree</h3>
					<p>If you can't find the right tree, check through the different fields. Every field has its own character just as every tree has its individual characteristics.  Most are traditionally shaped because they've been pruned regularly, but you'll also see the odd tree that refuses to conform.  These can make wonderful, artistic Christmas trees too!  Trees often look smaller in the field than they do in the house, especially once they are in their tree stands.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3>4. Cutting the Tree</h3>
					<p>If you have brought your own saw, use it if you'd like, or you may borrow ours. If you need help sawing, call a worker over to assist you -- tractor drivers have saws and can also give or summon help. All workers will be wearing red scarves.<br/><br/>Cut low to the ground and straight across.  You can always trim off the lower branches -- leave yourself enough trunk to fit in the tree stand.  If you can, have someone pull the tree slightly away from the side where you're cutting.  This will prevent the saw from binding and make the work much easier.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3>5. Tying it on/Putting it in</h3>
					<p>We will shake and bail your tree for you. Shaking will remove loose needles, and baling will wrap the tree to help fit it inside your trunk, van, or truck. If you choose to put the tree on top of your car, you may want to lay down an old blanket to avoid scratches. Aim the butt end forward so branches don't catch the wind, and tie it securely so it can't move freely in any direction. We recommend putting a plastic bag over the butt end of the tree, especially if it is travelling on the outside of the car. If you have a luggage rack, tying it twice to each side should do. Some people rope through the car doors (or windows, if you don't need to open your doors).  It's often a good idea to run a rope or two to the front and one to the back of the automobile. A piece of cardboard is nice to kneel on if you plan to tie the rope under your vehicle! Ask our friendly workers for help if you need it.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3>6. Once Home</h3>
					<p>Try to keep your tree in water at all times. Cutting a slice off of the base when you get home will help it absorb water.  For easiest handling, leave the netting on your tree until it's in the stand.  Then cut the strings and the tree will take its natural shape.  Keep it watered; it will soak up quite a lot of water the first few days!</p>

					<p>There is great satisfaction in choosing and cutting your own tree. Freshly cut trees stay fresh and green for much longer.  If you hear a faint cracking noise when the house is quiet, it might be pine cones opening in the warmth of your room.</p>
